## ðŸ“˜ Description
**CPP Module 02** is part of the C++ modules series from 42, focusing on operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical Form.  
It introduces the concept of fixed-point numbers and teaches how to manipulate them efficiently using C++ class features.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- **Ad-hoc polymorphism** (operator overloading)
- **Canonical form** of classes
- **Fixed-point number representation**
- **Arithmetic and comparison operator overloading**
- **Increment/decrement operators**
- **Const correctness**
- **Compiling with `-std=c++98`**

## ðŸ“‚ Exercises
The module is split into 3 exercises:
1. **Fixed** â€“ Implementation of a fixed-point number class with basic operations.
2. **Fixed (operators)** â€“ Extending the fixed-point class with comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operators.
3. **Fixed (advanced)** â€“ Adding min/max functions and refining operator overloads.
