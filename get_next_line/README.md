## ðŸ“˜ Description

**get_next_line** is a project with the goal of implementing a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns the next line, one call at a time â€” handling multiple file descriptors and partial reads, with efficient memory management and buffer control.

It reinforces knowledge of file I/O, static variables, string manipulation, and dynamic memory allocation.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- File descriptor manipulation (`read`)
- Static variables and persistent state
- Dynamic string allocation and joining
- Buffer management with fixed-size reads
- Memory safety and error handling
- Handling edge cases (e.g., EOF without newline)

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Compile the project:
```
make
```

2. Use it in your program:

```
gcc main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -I -D BUFFER_SIZE=42
```

3. Clean build files:
```bash
make clean      # Removes object files  
make fclean     # Removes object files and binaries  
make re         # Rebuilds everything
```
