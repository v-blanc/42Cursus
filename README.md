## 💡 About 42 School

**[42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)** is a **tuition-free**, **project-based**, and **peer-to-peer learning** computer science school, which is part of the global **[42 Network](https://www.42network.org/)**, with **50+ campuses worldwide**.

42’s innovative pedagogy is **100% hands-on**: there are no teachers, no classes, and no traditional schedule. Students learn through **collaborative projects**, **problem-solving**, and **self-paced work**, 24/7. The curriculum covers **algorithms, systems programming, web development, AI, cybersecurity**, and more, preparing students for careers in tech with a strong focus on **practical skills** and **adaptability**.

The **common core** (tronc commun) is the foundational part of the program, where students master **C/C++ programming, Unix, data structures, and low-level programming**, among other essential skills.

The various projects must be validated in the order of the ***‘Holy Graph’*** :
