## 📘 Description
**CPP Module 00** is the first step in the C++ modules series from 42.

- **Classes** and **member functions**
- **Access specifiers** (`public`, `private`)
- **std::string** manipulation
- **iostream** usage (`std::cout`, `std::cin`)
- **Compiling with `-std=c++98`**

## 📂 Exercices
The module is split into 3 exercises:
